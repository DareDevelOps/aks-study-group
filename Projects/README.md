# AKS Study Group Projects

## How to Contribute

For the Projects in this Repo I've been going to Azure Learn and looking at products and resources associated with the material I want to learn and share with the group.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Azure

Go to [Azure Learn]([https://learn.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular)) select a product and navigate to the Quick Starts.

## Quick Start: Web App Python 

[Deploy Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli)

1. [Sample Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#1---sample-application) 
   Most Quick Starts have a sample application associaed with them.

   This QS has 3 choices  
   - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)
   - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
   - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
  
2. [Create QS resources and deploy application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#2---create-a-web-app-in-azure)

Once again there are multiple methods for achieving this

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-pythonabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#tabpanel_3_azure-cli)   Method generally used by Operations.

- [VS Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cvscode-aztools%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#tabpanel_3_vscode-aztools) Method generally used by developers.
    
 - [Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-portal%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#tabpanel_3_azure-portal) Method generally used when learning.

These particular technology choices are presented based on the asusumption that since you are working on a Python project you are coming from a Mac or Linux back ground which is why Azure CLI is chosen over Azure PowerShell.

Each method gives specific instructions for using it. It also links to additional tools and technology that you may need to accomplish the task.

1. [Deploy Your Application Code to Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#3---deploy-your-application-code-to-azure)

   - [Deploy using Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#tabpanel_4_azure-cli-deploy)
   - [Deploy using VS Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cvscode-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#tabpanel_4_vscode-deploy)
   - [Deploy using local git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Clocal-git-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#tabpanel_4_local-git-deploy)

2. [Configure Startup script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#4---configure-startup-script)

3. [Browse to the App](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#5---browse-to-the-app)
4. [Stream logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=flask%2Cwindows%2Cazure-cli%2Cazure-cli-deploy%2Cdeploy-instructions-azportal%2Cterminal-bash%2Cdeploy-instructions-zip-azcli#6---stream-logs)
