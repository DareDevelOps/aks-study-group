# Git Basics

## Basic workflow

After you've cloned a repo there are several basic commands to learn.
all commands are prefaced with git.

```powereshell
git --help or git -h to list commands, sub-commands and command aruguments.
```

After you've made changes to the code there is a three part process to update the repo.

```powershell
git add modifed files to be tracked
git commit -m ' Add a message to detail the changes you are making.'
git push
```
