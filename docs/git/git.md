# Git Version control system

## Why Git

Installing the Base git CLI and tools will enable you to work with any Git version control system such as:

- [Azure Repos](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/?view=azure-devops)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
- [Git Lab](https://gitlab.com/)

Since we Use Azure Repos you're better off installing the base Git client and working with Git through VS Code
